## Project brief
[**Note:** To protect the client's data & confidentiality, all data has been replaced with dummy data]

<summary> <h3>ðŸ’¼[Problem]</h3> </summary>
  
- The client had trouble with a procedure that required people to enter feedback via a Google Form.<br>
- If there was more than 1 person that needed feedback for a specific incident, then people had to report the incident once per person involved, despite the rest of the information being the same.<br>
- This, of course, wasted time.

<summary> <h3>ðŸŽ¯[Desired outcome]</h3> </summary>

- The client wanted to change the procedure to allow multiple email addresses to be entered in the `person(s) receiving feedback` field of the Google Form.
- They also wanted a formula-based solution to split the Google Form responses into different rows of the Google Form (responses) spreadsheet.
  - They requested a formula-based solution, so that the solution would be dynamic and also so that they didn't need to run or maintain a script.
- The amount of rows to be generated in the Google Forms response spreadsheet is determined by how many email addresses are entered into the `person(s) receiving feedback` section of the Google Forms.
- The client wanted 1 row to be generated for each additional email address added to the specified question in the Google Form and all other information duplicated.
  - The standard behaviour for Google Forms is to generate 1 row per Google Forms entry. <br>

`Example:`
>If 3 email addresses are entered into the `person(s) receiving feedback` Google Forms question, then 3 entries need to be created in the Google Form responses spreadsheet (instead of the usual 1 entry)
